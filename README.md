## Overview

MDM Patcher is a command-line tool that helps remove Mobile Device Management (MDM) profiles from supervised iPhones and iPads. This is the Linux/Unix port of the original macOS GUI application.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ No jailbreak required
- ✅ No firmware modifications
- ✅ Works on Linux, macOS, and potentially other Unix systems
- ✅ Command-line interface for automation
- ✅ Supports iOS 15.0 - 18.5+
- ✅ Works with iPhone 5s through iPhone 16, all iPad models

---

## About This Fork

This is a fork of the original **[MDMPatcher-Linux](https://github.com/Gudui/MDMPatcher-Linux)** by Gudui.

**Key Enhancement**: This fork adds the ability to restore from existing user backups while patching for MDM removal. The original tool only worked with a minimal built-in template backup. This enhancement allows users to preserve their apps, settings, photos, messages, and other personal data during the MDM removal process.

## Building from Source

### Ubuntu/Debian Installation

#### 1. Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    git \
    autoconf \
    automake \
    libtool \
    libssl-dev \
    libzip-dev \
    libreadline-dev \
    libusb-1.0-0-dev \
    usbmuxd
```

#### 2. Build libimobiledevice Stack

The libimobiledevice ecosystem must be built in order. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir -p ~/mdm-build && cd ~/mdm-build

# 1. libplist
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist.git
cd libplist
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
cd ..

# 2. libimobiledevice-glue
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice-glue.git
cd libimobiledevice-glue
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
cd ..

# 3. libusbmuxd
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libusbmuxd.git
cd libusbmuxd
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
cd ..

# 4. libimobiledevice
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice.git
cd libimobiledevice
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
cd ..

# Update library cache
sudo ldconfig
```

#### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if libraries are found
pkg-config --modversion libimobiledevice-1.0
pkg-config --modversion libplist-2.0
pkg-config --modversion libirecovery-1.0
pkg-config --libs openssl libzip

# Test device detection
idevice_id -l
```

If `idevice_id -l` shows your device UDID, the installation is successful.

#### 4. Prepare Required Files

Place these files in your working directory:
- `extension1.pdf` - Info.plist template (encrypted)
- `extension2.pdf` - Manifest.plist template (encrypted)
- `libiMobileeDevice.dylib` - Backup structure archive (encrypted)

**Note:** These files are not included in this repository. They must be obtained from the original MDMPatcher Enhanced macOS application bundle.

#### 5. Compile MDM Patcher

```bash
# Clone or download the source code
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mdmpatcher

# Compile
gcc -o mdm_patch \
    main.c \
    patch_logic.c \
    idevicebackup2.c \
    libidevicefunctions.c \
    utils.c \
    -I. \
    -D_GNU_SOURCE \
    $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libimobiledevice-1.0 libimobiledevice-glue-1.0 libplist-2.0 openssl libzip libirecovery-1.0) \
    -lreadline -lm -lsqlite3

# Make executable
chmod +x mdm_patch
```

## Decrypting Encrypted Backups

If you have an encrypted iOS backup and want to use it with `--backup-source`, you must first decrypt it using the included Python tool.

### Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the tools directory
cd tools

# Option 1: Use the setup script (creates virtual environment)
./setup_venv.sh
source .venv/bin/activate

# Option 2: Install dependencies directly
pip install iphone_backup_decrypt tqdm
```

### Usage

```bash
# With password prompt (recommended)
python3 tools/decrypt_backup.py /path/to/encrypted_backup -o /path/to/decrypted_output

# With inline password
python3 tools/decrypt_backup.py /path/to/encrypted_backup -o /path/to/decrypted_output -p "your_password"
```

The decrypted backup will be created at the output path, preserving the iOS backup structure required for restoration.

**Note:** The decryption tool preserves the `BackupKeyBag` in `Manifest.plist`, which is required by iOS 15+ for restore operations.

---

## Utility Scripts

The `tools/` directory contains additional utility scripts for working with iOS backups and debugging:

### decrypt_backup.py
Decrypts iOS encrypted backups while preserving restore-compatible structure.

```bash
python3 tools/decrypt_backup.py /path/to/encrypted_backup -o /path/to/decrypted_output
```

Features:
- Decrypts all backup files while preserving SHA-1 filename structure
- Validates backup after decryption
- Can fix encryption metadata in existing decrypted backups
- Supports verbose output and dry-run validation

### setup_venv.sh
Creates a Python virtual environment and installs required dependencies.

```bash
cd tools
./setup_venv.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### check-manifestdb.py
Analyzes file blob metadata in Manifest.db, reporting field statistics and encryption key types.

```bash
python3 tools/check-manifestdb.py /path/to/Manifest.db
```

### dump-manifestdb.py
Analyzes Manifest.db to detect hard links, symbolic links, and report file metadata fields.

```bash
python3 tools/dump-manifestdb.py /path/to/Manifest.db
```

Features:
- Detects hard links (files sharing same InodeNumber)
- Detects symbolic links (files with Target field or symlink mode)
- Reports all fields present in file blobs
- ConfigurationProfiles link analysis

### verify-manifest.py
Validates backup integrity by comparing Manifest.db entries with actual files on disk.

```bash
python3 tools/verify-manifest.py /path/to/backup/directory
```

Exit codes:
- 0: All referenced files exist
- 1: Manifest.db not found
- 2: Missing files detected

### dump-enckeys.py
Extracts and displays encryption key information from sample files in Manifest.db.

```bash
python3 tools/dump-enckeys.py --db /path/to/Manifest.db
```

Shows EncryptionKey structure from first 5 files. Useful for understanding metadata format.

### dump-enckeys2.py
Lists all encrypted files in backup with encryption key previews.

```bash
python3 tools/dump-enckeys2.py /path/to/Manifest.db
```

Displays file paths, file IDs, key lengths, and key previews for all encrypted files.

---


## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. **Restore your device to factory settings** using iTunes/Finder or `idevicerestore`
2. **Do NOT complete the setup wizard** - stop at the WiFi selection screen
3. **Do NOT connect to WiFi** - this prevents MDM re-enrollment
4. Connect device via USB
5. Trust the computer when prompted on device

### Running the Patcher (Template Mode)

This mode uses the built-in template backup. It's the simplest approach but creates a minimal backup.

```bash
# Ensure required files are in the current directory
ls extension1.pdf extension2.pdf libiMobileeDevice.dylib

# Run the patcher
./mdm_patch
```

### Running the Patcher (User Backup Mode)

This mode uses your own decrypted backup, preserving your data while removing MDM profiles. This is useful when you want to keep apps, settings, and data from an existing backup.

```bash
# Step 1: Decrypt your encrypted backup (if needed)
python3 tools/decrypt_backup.py ~/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup/DEVICE_UDID \
    -o ~/DecryptedBackup

# Step 2: Run the patcher with your backup (basic usage)
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup

# Step 3: Provide backup password (required even for decrypted backups)
# The password is used to decrypt the BackupKeyBag for integrity verification
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --password "your_backup_password"

# Alternative: Modify backup in-place (saves disk space, modifies original)
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --in-place

# Alternative: Restore with system files (required for ConfigurationProfiles)
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --restore-system-files -p "password"

# Alternative: Preview changes without restoring (dry-run)
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --dry-run

# Alternative: Specify target device UDID explicitly
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --target-udid 00008150-XXXX -p "password"

# Advanced: Full example with all recommended flags
./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup \
    --password "your_backup_password" \
    --restore-system-files \
    --in-place \
    --debug
```

**Common User Backup Mode Scenarios**:

1. **Restoring from a fresh backup** (most common):
   ```bash
   ./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --password "your_password"
   ```

2. **Restoring with system files** (required for ConfigurationProfiles):
   ```bash
   ./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --password "your_password" --restore-system-files
   ```

3. **Testing without restoring** (dry-run to verify backup integrity):
   ```bash
   ./mdm_patch --backup-source ~/DecryptedBackup --dry-run
   ```

**Command-line Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-b, --backup-source PATH` | Use existing decrypted backup instead of built-in template |
| `-u, --target-udid UDID` | Target device UDID (default: auto-detect connected device) |
| `-p, --password PASSWORD` | Backup password for BackupKeyBag decryption during restore (see note below) |
| `-i, --in-place` | Modify backup directly instead of copying (saves disk space) |
| `--overwrite-existing-profiles` | Replace existing ConfigurationProfiles in backup with clean versions |
| `--ignore-manifest-sizes` | Skip Manifest.db size fix-ups during restore |
| `--show-size-mismatches` | Log each Manifest.db size mismatch detected |
| `--show-file-digests` | Log SHA1 digest for each file sent during restore |
| `--show-digest-mismatches` | Log each Manifest.db digest mismatch detected |
| `--abort-on-missing-files` | Abort restore if any backup file is missing |
| `--restore-system-files` | Enable restoration of system files (required for ConfigurationProfiles) |
| `-n, --dry-run` | Preview changes without performing restore |
| `-d, --debug` | Enable debug output (shows each file during restore) |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |
| `-V, --version` | Show version information |

> **Note on Backup Password (`-p`)**:  
> Even if you've already decrypted your backup files, the backup password is still required during restore. iOS uses the password to decrypt the `BackupKeyBag` metadata stored in `Manifest.plist`, which is essential for:
> - Verifying file integrity using SHA-1 digests
> - Properly handling encrypted file metadata
> - Ensuring the restore process completes successfully on iOS 15+
>
> The `BackupKeyBag` is preserved in the decrypted backup by `tools/decrypt_backup.py` for this exact reason.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: Could not connect to device"

**Causes:**
- Device not connected or not trusted
- usbmuxd not running
- Permission issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if device is detected
idevice_id -l

# Restart usbmuxd
sudo systemctl restart usbmuxd
# OR
sudo killall usbmuxd && sudo usbmuxd

# Check USB permissions (add user to plugdev group on Linux)
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

### "Error: Failed to decrypt extension files"

**Causes:**
- Missing or corrupted template files
- Wrong file versions

**Solution:**
- Ensure `extension1.pdf`, `extension2.pdf`, and `libiMobileeDevice.dylib` are from the correct MDMPatcher Enhanced version
- Verify file integrity (files should be encrypted, not actual PDFs)

### "Restore Failed (Error Code: -1)"

**Causes:**
- Find My is still enabled
- Device not on Setup Assistant screen
- Device locked

**Solutions:**
1. Factory reset device again
2. Stop at WiFi selection (do NOT proceed further)
3. Ensure Find My iPhone is disabled (should be disabled after factory reset without WiFi)
4. Keep device unlocked during the process
5. Try rebooting device and starting over

### "Restore Failed (Error Code: -205)" / "No keybag in manifest"

**Causes:**
- Missing `BackupKeyBag` in `Manifest.plist` (required by iOS 15+)
- Backup was decrypted with an older version of the decrypt tool that removed the keybag

**Solutions:**
1. Re-decrypt your backup using the updated `tools/decrypt_backup.py` script
2. The updated script preserves `BackupKeyBag` which is required for iOS 15+ restore operations

```bash
# Re-decrypt with updated tool
python3 tools/decrypt_backup.py /path/to/original_encrypted_backup \
    -o /path/to/new_decrypted_backup
```

### Build Errors

**"Package libimobiledevice-1.0 was not found"**
```bash
# Rebuild library cache
sudo ldconfig

# Check PKG_CONFIG_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

# Verify installation
pkg-config --list-all | grep libimobiledevice
```

**"undefined reference to PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1"**
```bash
# Ensure OpenSSL is properly linked
pkg-config --libs openssl
# Should show: -lssl -lcrypto

# On macOS, you may need to explicitly link OpenSSL
# Add to compile command:
-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib
```

## FAQ

**Q: Is this a jailbreak?**  
A: No. This tool does not modify iOS firmware or exploit any vulnerabilities. It uses Apple's legitimate backup restoration mechanism.

**Q: Will this work on a device that's currently enrolled in MDM?**  
A: No. The device must first be factory reset and stopped at the Setup Assistant WiFi screen.

**Q: Do I need to disable Find My iPhone?**  
A: Find My should be automatically disabled after a factory reset without WiFi connection. If it's still enabled, the restore will fail.

**Q: Can I use this on a corporate/school device?**  
A: **Absolutely not.** This is strictly for personally-owned devices only. Using this on managed devices without authorization is illegal.

**Q: Does this work on activation-locked devices?**  
A: No. Activation Lock is a separate security feature and cannot be bypassed with this tool.
